# TOSCA Framework - Problem Statement

## Overview

TOSCA is a structured framework for defining problems precisely. A problem well stated is half-solved. The framework consists of five essential elements that form the acronym TOSCA:

- **T**rouble - What makes this problem real and urgent?
- **O**wner - Whose problem is this?
- **S**uccess Criteria - What will success look like?
- **C**onstraints - What are the limitations?
- **A**ctors - Who are the stakeholders?

After completing TOSCA, formulate a **Core Question** that captures the problem essence.

## The Five TOSCA Elements

### T - Trouble: What Makes This Real and Present?

**Definition:** The gap between current situation and aspiration (problem or opportunity).

**Key Principles:**
- Define in specific, concrete terms
- Usually describe symptoms, NOT interpretations or diagnoses
- Answer "Why now?" - what makes this urgent?
- Avoid premature diagnosis unless confidence is very high

**Bad Example (Diagnosis):**  
"The problem is piracy in the music industry"

**Good Example (Symptom):**  
"Music sales have declined 15% annually for the past 3 years"

**When to Diagnose vs. Describe Symptoms:**
- Diagnose only when: Problem belongs to a well-known category with proven remedies
- Describe symptoms when: Problem is novel, complex, or poorly understood
- **Default: When in doubt, stick to symptoms**

**Critical Warning:** Experienced problem solvers often misdiagnose new situations as familiar ones. The more experienced you are, the more vulnerable to this trap.

### O - Owner: Whose Problem Is This?

**Definition:** The person who will judge whether the problem definition and solution are "good enough."

**Why It Matters:**
- Owner identity shapes the solution space
- Different owners = different definitions of success
- Only the owner can declare problem "solved"

**Example: Music Industry Piracy**
- If owner = RIAA (industry body): Solution space limited to lobbying and advertising
- If owner = Major label CEO: Solution space includes pricing, business models, product strategy

**Key Questions:**
- Who has the authority to act on solutions?
- Who controls resources needed for implementation?
- Whose problem-solving mandate matches this issue?
- Who will be held accountable for results?

**Wicked Problems:** Some problems have no clear owner or multiple owners with irreconcilable objectives. These don't lend themselves to this methodology.

### S - Success Criteria: What Will Success Look Like, and When?

**Definition:** Concrete description of what success looks like, ideally with measurable outcomes.

**The Time-Travel Question:**  
"We are in the future, having dinner to celebrate success. What is the date, and what do we see?"

**Why This Works:**
- Forces specificity about outcomes
- Reveals implicit success metrics
- Prevents defining problems by their solutions
- Opens discussion about real objectives

**Bad Success Criteria:**
- "Stop piracy" (restates the trouble)
- "Implement anti-piracy technology" (prescribes solution)
- "We need to make downloads more difficult" (defines problem by solution)

**Good Success Criteria:**
- "Restore revenue growth to 5-7% annually"
- "Increase market share by 10 points within 3 years"
- "Reduce customer churn to below 15%"

**Quantified Targets:**

Two schools of thought:

1. **Open-ended approach:** "Maximize revenues while maintaining profitability"
   - Pro: Doesn't force arbitrary numbers
   - Con: May not focus thinking or justify resources

2. **Aspirational target:** "Achieve $500M revenue by Q4 2026"
   - Pro: Focuses mind, stretches thinking, justifies resources
   - Con: May be unrealistic
   - **Solution: Be prepared to revise as you learn**

### C - Constraints: What Are the Limitations and Trade-Offs?

**Definition:** Limits on what solutions are feasible, from the owner's perspective.

**Three Types of Constraints:**

1. **Constraints on Success Criteria**
   - Conflicts with other objectives/commitments
   - Trade-offs between goals
   - Example: "Grow revenue BUT maintain 20% profit margin AND keep current headcount"

2. **Resource and Capability Constraints**
   - Budget limitations
   - Skill/expertise gaps
   - Technology limitations
   - Time constraints
   - Example: "No digital skills in organization to build streaming platform"

3. **Process Constraints**
   - Confidentiality requirements
   - Time limits for problem-solving effort
   - Budget for analysis
   - Visibility concerns
   - Example: "Can't set up visible task force that signals panic to markets"

**Critical Balance:**
- Identify constraints early to avoid wasted effort
- BUT don't over-constrain or problem becomes "make trouble disappear without changing anything"
- Be prepared to relax constraints as problem-solving proceeds

**Example: Music Industry**
- Initial constraint: "Restore past revenue growth" → Unrealistic
- Revised: "Stabilize revenues while building new business model"

### A - Actors: Who Are the Stakeholders?

**Definition:** Important stakeholders whose objectives, behaviors, and perspectives shape the problem and potential solutions.

**Why Actors Matter:**
- Each sees the problem differently
- Their behaviors may contribute to or solve the problem
- Their buy-in may be needed for implementation
- Understanding their needs leads to better solutions

**How to Identify Actors:**
- Who is affected by this problem?
- Who can influence outcomes?
- Whose behavior needs to change?
- Who has veto power over solutions?
- Whose support is needed for implementation?

**Empathy Requirement:**
To state meaningful problems, see them simultaneously from multiple angles. Put yourself in each actor's shoes.

**Example: Music Industry**
- Recording executives → See loss of control and revenue
- College students → Want convenience, immediate access, good user experience
- Artists → Want fair compensation and broad distribution
- Retailers → Fear being disintermediated
- Technology companies → See opportunity for new platforms

**Empathy Techniques:**

1. **Problem Definition Interviews**
   - Ask TOSCA questions to each stakeholder
   - "What is the trouble from your perspective?"
   - "What would success look like to you?"
   - Get diverse viewpoints

2. **Immersion**
   - When interviews aren't enough
   - Observe actors' behaviors directly
   - Experience their situation firsthand
   - Example: Ron Johnson should have spent time with J.C. Penney shoppers

**Benefits of Actor Analysis:**
- Refines problem statement
- Generates solution ideas (actors volunteer opinions)
- Builds stakeholder goodwill
- Prevents blind spots

## Formulating the Core Question

After completing TOSCA, synthesize into a single Core Question that captures problem essence.

**Characteristics of Good Core Questions:**

1. **Compatible with TOSCA elements**
   - Consistent with trouble, owner, success criteria, constraints, actors
   - Neither too broad nor too narrow

2. **Can be open or closed**
   - Open: "How can we restore revenue growth?"
   - Closed: "Should we sell division X?"
   - Choice depends on how well-defined the solution space is

3. **Scope matches problem complexity**
   - Narrow: "Which supplier should we choose?"
   - Broad: "How should we compete in this market?"

**Examples:**

**Music Industry Problem:**
- Poor: "How do we stop piracy?"
- Good: "How can Major Label X restore revenue growth within 3 years while transitioning to digital distribution?"

**Solar Corporation (manufacturing):**
- Poor: "What to do about Pluto and Uranus divisions?"
- Good: "How should Solar address the losses in Pluto and Uranus divisions to return to profitable growth?"

## The Iterative Nature of Problem Definition

**Key Insight:** There is no single "right" problem definition, but many wrong ones.

**Why Iteration:**
- Each coherent problem statement is a "frame" on the problem
- Multiple valid frames can coexist
- As you gather facts and generate options, refine the statement
- Structuring stage (next step) helps refine problem statement

**Process:**
1. Draft initial TOSCA
2. Identify what you don't know
3. Gather information / conduct interviews
4. Refine TOSCA elements
5. Update core question
6. Revisit periodically throughout problem-solving

**Collaborative Effort:**
- Involves multiple stakeholders
- Different perspectives strengthen definition
- "Singing TOSCA as a choir" - collective definition exercise
- Build consensus and shared understanding

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Jumping to solutions too quickly**
   - "The problem is we need anti-piracy technology"
   - Stay with problem definition before solving

2. **Confusing trouble with diagnosis**
   - Symptoms ≠ Root causes
   - Describe observable gap, not interpretation

3. **Defining problem by proposed solution**
   - Success criteria that presuppose solutions
   - Locks you into confirmation bias

4. **Insufficient empathy**
   - Only seeing from owner's perspective
   - Missing how other actors experience problem

5. **Over-constraining**
   - Too many constraints = problem becomes unsolvable
   - Need to relax some constraints to find solutions

6. **Vague success criteria**
   - "Things get better"
   - Need specific, measurable outcomes

## When to Pivot to Design Thinking

If after TOSCA you find:
- Problem is still hard to define precisely
- Actors' needs are unclear or contradictory
- Context is highly ambiguous
- Need deep user understanding

→ Use design thinking's Empathize and Define phases (see references/design-thinking.md) before proceeding to Structure.
