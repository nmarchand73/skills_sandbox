# Selling Solutions: Communication and Presentation

## Core Principle

**Don't tell the story of your search. Tell the story of the solution.**

Problem solvers think chronologically (State → Structure → Solve). But audiences want the answer first, then the reasoning.

## The Pyramid Principle

### Structure

```
[CORE MESSAGE: The Answer]
    ├─ [KEY ARGUMENT 1]
    │   ├─ Evidence
    │   └─ Evidence
    ├─ [KEY ARGUMENT 2]
    │   ├─ Evidence
    │   └─ Evidence
    └─ [KEY ARGUMENT 3]
        ├─ Evidence
        └─ Evidence
```

### Rules

1. **Start with the answer** (core message at top)
2. **Group supporting ideas** (3-5 key arguments)
3. **Each level answers question raised by level above**
4. **Ideas in each grouping must be:**
   - Same type (all arguments or all evidence)
   - Logically ordered
   - MECE if possible

### Example

**Bad (Chronological):**
"First we analyzed the market. Then we surveyed customers. Then we modeled financials. Therefore, we recommend expanding to Canada."

**Good (Pyramid):**
"We recommend expanding to Canada via De Marque partnership. Three reasons: (1) Market is $80M and growing, (2) De Marque has local publisher relationships we need, (3) Financial projections show 25% IRR."

## Two Storyline Patterns

### Pattern 1: Grouping (Most Common)

**Structure:** "The answer is X. Here are N reasons why."

**Formula:**
- Core message: Recommendation
- 3-5 pillars: Independent supporting arguments
- Each pillar backed by evidence

**Example:**
```
"Librinova should expand to Canada"
  ├─ Market is attractive ($80M, 15% growth)
  ├─ Partnership model reduces risk
  └─ ROI is compelling (25% IRR, 3-year payback)
```

**When to use:** Most business recommendations, strategic choices

### Pattern 2: Argument (Situation-Complication-Resolution)

**Structure:** Tell a story with tension and resolution

**Formula:**
1. **Situation:** Stable state, context
2. **Complication:** Problem/opportunity emerges
3. **Resolution:** Your recommendation solves it

**Example:**
```
Situation: "Librinova successful in France, investors want growth"
Complication: "But self-publishing is local, internationalization is hard"
Resolution: "Partner with De Marque in Canada to leverage local connections"
```

**When to use:** When you need to convince skeptical audience, change status quo

## Crafting Your Core Message

### What Makes a Good Core Message?

**Characteristics:**
- **Actionable:** Clear what to do
- **Specific:** Not vague generalization
- **Concise:** One sentence
- **Answers the original question**
- **Stands alone:** Complete without explanation

**Examples:**

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "The market is interesting" | "Enter Canadian market via De Marque partnership" |
| "We should do more research" | "Pilot program in Quebec, decide on full launch in 6 months" |
| "There are pros and cons" | "Don't expand now; revisit in 18 months when platform matures" |

### The "So What?" Test

After stating core message, audience should think:
- "I understand the recommendation"
- "I want to know why"
- NOT "So what?" or "What does that mean?"

## Building the Storyline

### Step 1: Write Core Message

State your recommendation clearly and specifically.

### Step 2: Identify 3-5 Key Arguments

**Ask:** "Why should they believe my core message?"

**Arguments should be:**
- Independent (don't overlap)
- Collectively persuasive (together they convince)
- Ordered logically

**Logical Orders:**
- Priority (most important first)
- Time sequence (chronological)
- Structural (analysis structure)
- Comparison (compare alternatives)

### Step 3: Support Each Argument with Evidence

**Types of Evidence:**
- Data/facts: Numbers, statistics
- Analysis: Calculations, models
- Examples: Case studies, analogies
- Expert opinion: Interviews, research
- Prototypes: Design thinking results

### Step 4: Map to Slide Pages

Each element in storyline = one slide:
- Core message → Executive summary slide
- Each key argument → Section divider slide
- Each piece of evidence → Content slide

## Creating the Report/Presentation

### Structure

**Part 1: Storyline (Executive Summary)**
- Core message slide
- 3-5 key argument slides
- Self-sufficient (decision-maker can stop here)

**Part 2: Content (Supporting Detail)**
- Detailed analysis pages
- Data, charts, evidence
- For deep-dive discussion

### Slide Design Principles

**The One-Minute Rule:**
Each slide should communicate its point in 60 seconds.

**Elements:**
1. **Headline:** Complete sentence stating the point
   - Bad: "Market Analysis"
   - Good: "Canadian market is $80M and growing at 15%"

2. **Body:** Chart or text supporting headline
   - One main visual or 5-7 bullet points max
   - Clear, simple, focused

3. **Source:** Always cite data sources

### Chart Design

**Quantitative Charts:**
- Column: Time series, comparisons
- Bar: Rankings, comparisons
- Line: Trends over time
- Pie: Part-to-whole (use sparingly)
- Waterfall: Build-up of components
- Scatter: Correlations

**Conceptual Charts:**
- 2x2 matrices
- Process flows
- Hierarchies
- Relationships

**Rules:**
- One insight per chart
- Title states the insight
- Emphasize key data (color, size, annotation)
- Remove clutter (gridlines, 3D, excess precision)

### Quality Control Checklist

For each slide, ask:

**Is it RELEVANT?**
- "So what?" Does it matter for the decision?
- Could we remove it without losing argument?

**Is it TRUE?**
- "Says who?" Is the source credible?
- Are calculations correct?
- Is interpretation fair?

**Is it NEW?**
- "Should we care?" Is this surprising or important?
- Does it add to what audience already knows?

### The "Trim Ruthlessly" Principle

**Signs of over-inclusion:**
- Slides you can't explain in 1 minute
- Analysis that doesn't support key arguments
- "Interesting but not decisive" content
- Backup slides in main deck

**Solution:**
- Move to appendix
- Create separate detailed report
- Trust your storyline
- Less is more

## Delivery Best Practices

### Before Presentation

1. **Know your audience**
   - What's their decision timeline?
   - What's their starting position?
   - What will they challenge?
   - What do they care about?

2. **Prepare for questions**
   - Anticipate objections
   - Have backup analysis ready
   - Know your numbers cold

3. **Practice storyline**
   - Can you tell the story without slides?
   - Is logic clear?
   - Does it flow?

### During Presentation

1. **Start with core message**
   - Don't bury the lead
   - State recommendation upfront
   - Then explain why

2. **Pace the dialogue**
   - Pause for questions
   - Engage in discussion
   - Don't rush through

3. **Read the room**
   - Are they with you?
   - Do they need more detail?
   - Should you skip ahead?

4. **Handle objections**
   - Listen fully
   - Acknowledge valid points
   - Address directly
   - Don't be defensive

### After Presentation

1. **Capture action items**
2. **Follow up on open questions**
3. **Refine based on feedback**

## Common Communication Mistakes

1. **Chronological storytelling**
   - Walking through your analysis process
   - Saving recommendation for end

2. **No clear core message**
   - Vague conclusions
   - Multiple recommendations
   - "It depends" without clear choice

3. **Too much detail**
   - Every analysis you did
   - Slides that could be bullets
   - Loss of forest for trees

4. **Poor visual design**
   - Cluttered charts
   - Unclear headlines
   - Data without interpretation

5. **Ignoring audience**
   - Not tailoring to their concerns
   - Wrong level of detail
   - Missing what they care about

## Communication Throughout Process

Don't wait until the end to communicate:

**During STATE:**
- Share problem statement draft
- Get feedback early
- Align on scope

**During STRUCTURE:**
- Show pyramid/tree structure
- Validate approach
- Adjust based on input

**During SOLVE:**
- Share interim findings
- Course-correct if needed
- Build buy-in progressively

**Benefits:**
- No surprises at the end
- Stakeholder buy-in
- Better final product
- Smoother decision process

## The Virtuous Cycle

Good structure → Good analysis → Good communication

**Your pyramid/tree IS your storyline:**
- Hypothesis pyramid → Grouping pattern
- Issue tree → Grouping pattern
- Design thinking → Argument pattern (user need story)

**Evidence from analysis:**
- Each analysis → Supporting evidence
- Prioritized analyses → Key arguments
- Structure → Logical flow

## Final Reminder

**Communication is not cosmetic.**

It's not PowerPoint formatting tricks. It's:
- Clear thinking
- Logical structure
- Persuasive argumentation
- Empathy for audience

If you can't communicate the solution clearly, you probably haven't solved the problem well enough.
