# Analytical Frameworks for Problem Structuring

## Overview

Frameworks provide pre-packaged decompositions of recurring business problems. They're shortcuts that help build issue trees faster but come with risks.

## The Framework Paradox

**Benefits:**
- Save time structuring problems
- Provide MECE breakdowns
- Leverage proven patterns
- Enable faster analysis

**Dangers:**
- Force problems into wrong categories
- Blind you to unique factors
- Embed unstated assumptions
- Lead to "wrong framework" pitfall

**Golden Rule:** Only use frameworks when they genuinely fit the problem. Don't force-fit.

## When to Use Frameworks

✅ **Use when:**
- Problem fits a well-known category
- Framework assumptions match your situation
- Need speed and pattern applies
- Starting point for customization

❌ **Don't use when:**
- Problem is novel or unique
- Framework assumptions don't hold
- Forces you to ignore key factors
- You're using it just because it's familiar

## Three Ways to Break Down Problems

### 1. Industry/Value Driver Frameworks

Based on how industries and businesses create value.

**Examples:**
- Porter's 5 Forces (industry attractiveness)
- Value Chain (cost/differentiation sources)
- Business Model Canvas (how company creates value)

**Best for:** Industry analysis, competitive strategy, market entry

### 2. Functional Frameworks

Based on business functions and activities.

**Examples:**
- 4Ps Marketing Mix (Product, Price, Place, Promotion)
- Operations frameworks (capacity, quality, efficiency)
- HR frameworks (recruitment, development, retention)

**Best for:** Functional improvement, operational issues

### 3. Logical Decomposition

Pure logic without pre-existing framework.

**Examples:**
- Mathematical: Revenue = Price × Volume
- Causal: Change = Awareness → Understanding → Action
- Segmentation: By customer type, geography, product line

**Best for:** When no framework fits, problem-specific logic

## Key Strategy Frameworks

### Porter's 5 Forces (Industry Attractiveness)

**Question:** Is this an attractive industry?

**Forces:**
1. Threat of new entrants
2. Bargaining power of suppliers
3. Bargaining power of buyers
4. Threat of substitutes
5. Rivalry among existing competitors

**Use for:** Market entry, investment, competitive analysis

**Assumptions:**
- Industry boundaries are clear
- Five forces capture main dynamics
- Focus is on industry profitability

### Value Chain (Competitive Advantage)

**Question:** Where do we create value?

**Primary Activities:**
- Inbound logistics → Operations → Outbound logistics → Marketing & Sales → Service

**Support Activities:**
- Infrastructure, HR, Technology, Procurement

**Use for:** Cost analysis, differentiation sources, operational improvement

### BCG Growth-Share Matrix (Portfolio)

**Question:** How should we allocate resources?

**Quadrants:**
- Stars (high growth, high share)
- Cash Cows (low growth, high share)
- Question Marks (high growth, low share)
- Dogs (low growth, low share)

**Use for:** Portfolio management, resource allocation

**Warning:** Oversimplifies, assumes market share = profitability

## Key Marketing Frameworks

### 4Ps Marketing Mix

**Elements:**
1. Product (features, quality, design)
2. Price (strategy, tactics, perception)
3. Place (distribution, channels, coverage)
4. Promotion (advertising, PR, sales)

**Extended:** Sometimes 7Ps (+ People, Process, Physical Evidence)

**Use for:** Marketing strategy, go-to-market planning

### STP (Segmentation-Targeting-Positioning)

**Steps:**
1. Segment market
2. Target specific segments
3. Position offering

**Use for:** Market entry, product launch, competitive strategy

### Customer Journey Map

**Stages:**
- Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Experience → Loyalty

**Use for:** Customer experience improvement, service design

## Key Operations Frameworks

### Theory of Constraints

**Focus:** Identify and manage bottleneck

**Steps:**
1. Identify constraint
2. Exploit it
3. Subordinate everything to it
4. Elevate it
5. Repeat

**Use for:** Capacity, throughput, efficiency problems

### Lean/Six Sigma

**Focus:** Eliminate waste, reduce variation

**DMAIC:**
- Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control

**Use for:** Quality, efficiency, cost reduction

## Key Finance Frameworks

### DuPont Analysis

**Formula:** ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier

**Use for:** Profitability analysis, identifying improvement levers

### DCF/NPV

**Components:**
- Cash flows
- Discount rate
- Terminal value

**Use for:** Investment decisions, valuation

## Framework Selection Guide

### Step 1: Understand Your Core Question

What type of question are you answering?
- Industry/market question → Industry frameworks
- Internal operations → Functional frameworks
- Unique situation → Logical decomposition

### Step 2: Check Framework Fit

Ask:
- Do framework assumptions match reality?
- Does it cover what matters in my situation?
- Am I forcing the problem to fit?

### Step 3: Customize Framework

- Start with framework structure
- Add problem-specific branches
- Remove irrelevant elements
- Challenge framework assumptions

### Step 4: Validate with "So What?"

For each branch:
- Is this relevant to my decision?
- Will answering this change my recommendation?
- Am I analyzing just because framework says to?

## Common Framework Mistakes

1. **Framework Addiction**
   - Using frameworks out of habit
   - Not questioning assumptions
   - Believing frameworks are "truth"

2. **Framework Forcing**
   - Making problem fit framework
   - Ignoring factors framework omits
   - Missing problem-specific drivers

3. **Framework Paralysis**
   - Using too many frameworks
   - Getting lost in analytical complexity
   - Forgetting the actual question

4. **Framework Worship**
   - Treating framework as complete solution
   - Not customizing to situation
   - Ignoring contradictory evidence

## The "Good Old Logic" Escape Route

When frameworks don't fit, use pure logic:

**Mathematical Decomposition:**
- Profit = Revenue - Cost
- Revenue = Price × Volume
- Volume = Market Size × Market Share

**Process Decomposition:**
- Break into sequential steps
- Identify inputs and outputs
- Map dependencies

**Segmentation:**
- By customer, geography, product
- By time period
- By behavior or characteristic

**Causal Logic:**
- What causes what?
- What are necessary vs. sufficient conditions?
- What are root causes vs. symptoms?

## Integration with Pyramids and Trees

**Hypothesis Pyramids:**
- Frameworks suggest which conditions to test
- Example: Porter's 5 Forces → 5 sub-hypotheses

**Issue Trees:**
- Frameworks provide MECE breakdown
- Example: Value Chain → question per activity

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Start with framework for high-level structure
- Customize branches for specific situation
- Add pure logic where framework doesn't fit
