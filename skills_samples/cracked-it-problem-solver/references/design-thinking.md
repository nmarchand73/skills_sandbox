# Design Thinking Process

## Overview

Design thinking is an alternative problem-solving approach for complex, user-centered problems that resist logical decomposition. Based on IDEO and Stanford d.school methodology.

## When to Use Design Thinking

Use when:
- Problem is poorly understood or hard to articulate
- Solutions must be designed for people (customers, users, employees)
- Context is highly complex with many unknowns
- Need creative, innovative solutions
- Analytical approaches aren't yielding insights
- User needs are unclear or contradictory

Don't use when:
- Problem is well-defined and analytical
- Proven solutions exist
- Speed is critical and hypothesis is strong
- Resources for iteration are limited

## The Five Phases

```
EMPATHIZE → DEFINE → IDEATE → PROTOTYPE → TEST
   ↑                                          ↓
   └──────────── Iterate ─────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 1: EMPATHIZE

**Goal:** Deeply understand users and their needs

**Methods:**

1. **Observation (Fly-on-the-Wall)**
   - Watch users in natural context
   - Don't intervene, just observe
   - Note what they do, not just what they say
   - Look for workarounds, frustrations, delights

2. **Participant Observation**
   - Experience the situation yourself
   - Immerse in user's world
   - Feel what they feel

3. **Semi-Structured Interviews**
   - Open questions: "Tell me about..."
   - Follow interesting threads
   - Ask "why" to get deeper
   - Focus on stories and examples
   - Listen for emotions and motivations

4. **Empathy Maps**
   - Say: What do they say?
   - Think: What do they think?
   - Do: What do they do?
   - Feel: What do they feel?

**Best Practices:**
- Observe real behavior, not hypothetical
- Engage with diverse users (not just obvious ones)
- Look for extreme users (lead users, struggling users)
- Suspend judgment, don't evaluate
- Focus on needs, not solutions

### Phase 2: DEFINE

**Goal:** Synthesize observations into actionable problem statement

**Methods:**

1. **Synthesize Insights**
   - Pattern across observations
   - Contradictions and tensions
   - Surprises and anomalies
   - Unmet needs

2. **User Needs Statement**
   Format: "[User] needs [need] because [insight]"
   Example: "Busy parents need quick healthy meals because they value family time over cooking"

3. **Point-of-View (POV) Statement**
   Format: "[User] needs to [need] but [barrier]"
   Example: "Commuters need to read on trains but can't focus in noisy environment"

4. **Design Imperatives (HMW)**
   Format: "How Might We [solve need]?"
   Example: "How might we help commuters focus in noisy environments?"

**Key Differences from TOSCA:**
- User-centered (not owner-centered)
- Need-focused (not solution-focused)
- Opens possibilities (doesn't constrain)

### Phase 3: IDEATE

**Goal:** Generate many possible solutions

**Methods:**

1. **Brainstorming Rules**
   - Defer judgment (no "but...")
   - Encourage wild ideas
   - Build on others' ideas
   - Stay focused on topic
   - One conversation at a time
   - Be visual
   - Go for quantity

2. **SCAMPER Technique**
   - Substitute: What can replace X?
   - Combine: What can merge with X?
   - Adapt: What else is like X?
   - Modify: What can change about X?
   - Put to other use: New ways to use X?
   - Eliminate: What to remove?
   - Reverse: What to flip/opposite?

3. **Analogies and Metaphors**
   - "It's like... but for..."
   - Cross-industry inspiration
   - Nature-inspired solutions

4. **Constraint Removal**
   - "What if money/time/tech wasn't an issue?"
   - Then work backward to reality

**Convergence:**
- Cluster similar ideas
- Identify themes
- Vote on most promising (dot voting)
- Select 2-3 to prototype

### Phase 4: PROTOTYPE

**Goal:** Make ideas tangible quickly and cheaply

**Types:**

1. **Sketches/Storyboards**
   - Visual representation
   - User journey
   - Key interactions

2. **Physical Models**
   - Cardboard, clay, LEGOs
   - Quick and rough
   - Just enough to test concept

3. **Role-Playing**
   - Act out service/experience
   - Bodystorm the interaction

4. **Wizard of Oz**
   - Fake the backend
   - Manual process behind automated facade
   - Test concept before building

5. **Minimum Viable Prototype**
   - Simplest version that tests assumption
   - One feature, roughly implemented

**Principles:**
- Quick: Hours/days, not weeks
- Cheap: Use available materials
- Rough: Don't polish
- Testable: Addresses key assumption
- Multiple: Build several alternatives

**What to Prototype:**
- User interface mockups
- Service blueprints
- Physical spaces/products
- Customer journeys
- Business model concepts

### Phase 5: TEST

**Goal:** Learn from users, iterate solution

**Methods:**

1. **Show and Tell**
   - Present prototype to users
   - Let them interact
   - Observe reactions

2. **Structured Feedback**
   - What works?
   - What doesn't?
   - What surprises?
   - What's missing?

3. **A/B Testing**
   - Compare alternatives
   - Measure preferences/behaviors

4. **Pilot/Beta**
   - Limited real-world deployment
   - Monitor usage and outcomes

**Critical:**
- Test with real users (not colleagues)
- Observe behavior (not just feedback)
- Look for what you didn't expect
- Ask "why" to understand reactions

**Iterate:**
- Refine prototype based on learning
- Test again
- Repeat until solution works
- Don't fall in love with first prototype

## Iteration and Integration

**Non-Linear Process:**
- Jump between phases as you learn
- Empathize → Learn need is wrong → Re-define
- Prototype → Reveals new needs → Re-empathize
- Test → Fails → Re-ideate

**Integration with 4S Method:**

| 4S Step | Design Thinking |
|---------|----------------|
| STATE | Empathize + Define |
| STRUCTURE | Define (HMW questions) |
| SOLVE | Ideate + Prototype + Test |
| SELL | Use prototypes as evidence |

**Hybrid Approach:**
1. Use TOSCA for initial problem statement
2. If problem is unclear → Empathize phase
3. Structure with issue tree OR use HMW questions
4. If solutions require creativity → Ideate, Prototype, Test
5. Sell using both analysis AND prototypes

## Abductive Reasoning

**Design Thinking Logic:**
- Analytical: Deduce from principles
- Design: Abduce from observations
- Generate most plausible explanation
- Must be tested and validated

**Example:**
- Observation: Users abandon shopping carts
- Abduction: Maybe shipping costs are too high
- Hypothesis: Offering free shipping will reduce abandonment
- Test: Prototype and measure

## Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping Empathize**
   - Jumping to solutions
   - Assuming you know users
   - Not observing real behavior

2. **Solving Wrong Problem**
   - Not synthesizing insights
   - Using initial problem statement
   - Not reframing based on learning

3. **Idea Selection Too Early**
   - Picking first idea
   - Not generating enough options
   - Falling in love with solution

4. **Over-Polished Prototypes**
   - Taking too long
   - Getting attached to version
   - Afraid to show rough work

5. **Testing with Wrong People**
   - Colleagues, not users
   - Listening to opinions, not observing
   - Not iterating based on results

## Design Thinking Mindset

**Critical Attitudes:**
- Beginner's mind (no assumptions)
- Bias toward action (prototype > talk)
- Radical collaboration (diverse views)
- Embrace ambiguity (comfort with uncertainty)
- Learn from failure (iteration mindset)
- Show, don't tell (visual, tangible)

## When to Stop

Design thinking is iterative, but not endless:

**Stop when:**
- Users consistently respond positively
- Solution addresses core need
- Prototype is validated
- Ready for implementation
- Diminishing returns on iteration

**Then:**
- Move to SELL phase
- Use prototypes and test results as evidence
- Tell story of user journey and solution
