# Eight Degrees of Analysis

## Overview

After structuring the problem (pyramid or tree), plan and execute analyses to answer each sub-hypothesis or sub-question. The "Eight Degrees" represent a spectrum from quick estimates to rigorous research.

## The Spectrum of Analysis

**Degree 1: Back-of-Envelope**
- Quick calculations using rough estimates
- Time: Minutes to hours
- Cost: Free
- Accuracy: Order of magnitude

**Degree 2: Existing Internal Knowledge**
- Use data/insights already in organization
- Time: Hours to days
- Cost: Minimal
- Accuracy: Depends on data quality

**Degree 3: Existing External Knowledge**
- Use published data, reports, studies
- Time: Days
- Cost: Low (subscription databases)
- Accuracy: Variable, check sources

**Degree 4: Consultation with Experts**
- Interview people with relevant expertise
- Time: Days to weeks
- Cost: Low to medium
- Accuracy: Depends on expert quality

**Degree 5: Structured Analysis of Compiled Data**
- Gather, clean, analyze existing data
- Time: Weeks
- Cost: Medium
- Accuracy: Good if data is reliable

**Degree 6: Primary Qualitative Research**
- Interviews, focus groups, observation
- Time: Weeks to months
- Cost: Medium to high
- Accuracy: Deep insights, limited generalizability

**Degree 7: Primary Quantitative Research**
- Surveys, experiments, A/B tests
- Time: Months
- Cost: High
- Accuracy: Statistically robust

**Degree 8: Academic-Grade Research**
- Rigorous scientific study
- Time: Months to years
- Cost: Very high
- Accuracy: Highest, peer-reviewed

## Analysis Planning Framework

### Step 1: List All Analyses Needed

From your structure (pyramid or tree):
- Each sub-hypothesis → Analysis to test it
- Each sub-question → Analysis to answer it

### Step 2: Prioritize by Two Dimensions

**Dimension 1: Decisiveness**
- Will this analysis change my recommendation?
- High decisiveness: Could flip decision
- Low decisiveness: Just confirms what we know

**Dimension 2: Difficulty**
- How hard/expensive/time-consuming?
- Consider: time, cost, data access, expertise needed

### Step 3: Create Priority Matrix

```
           High Decisiveness    Low Decisiveness
Easy       [DO FIRST]          [DO IF TIME]
Hard       [DO CAREFULLY]      [SKIP]
```

**Do First:** High impact, low effort → Quick wins
**Do Carefully:** High impact, high effort → Core analyses
**Do If Time:** Low impact, low effort → Nice to have
**Skip:** Low impact, high effort → Waste of resources

### Step 4: Apply "Satisficing"

Don't aim for perfection, aim for "good enough to decide."

**Key Questions:**
- What level of confidence do I need?
- What's the cost of being wrong?
- What's the cost of delay for more analysis?

**Rule:** Start with lower degrees (1-3), escalate only if needed

## Analysis Execution Principles

### Principle 1: Start Simple

- Begin with Degree 1-2 (back-of-envelope, internal data)
- Only move to higher degrees if answer is unclear
- Many questions can be answered quickly

### Principle 2: Triangulate

- Use multiple methods for critical analyses
- Cross-check findings from different sources
- Build confidence through convergence

### Principle 3: Know When to Stop

- Analyze until you can confidently recommend
- More analysis ≠ better decision
- Diminishing returns set in quickly

### Principle 4: Keep Problem Statement in View

- Does this analysis address our core question?
- Are we analyzing just because we can?
- Relevance > thoroughness

## Common Analysis Types

### Market Sizing
- Top-down: Total market → segments
- Bottom-up: Unit economics → scale up
- Triangulate both approaches

### Competitive Analysis
- Who are competitors?
- How do they compete?
- What are their strengths/weaknesses?
- Use Porter's 5 Forces as framework

### Financial Analysis
- Revenue projections
- Cost structure
- Break-even, ROI, NPV
- Sensitivity analysis

### Customer Analysis
- Who are they?
- What do they want/need?
- How do they behave?
- What drives their decisions?

### Operations Analysis
- Process mapping
- Capacity analysis
- Bottleneck identification
- Efficiency metrics

## From Structure to Analysis Plan

### Example: Hypothesis Pyramid

**Hypothesis:** "Expand to Canada via De Marque partnership"

**Sub-Hypothesis 1:** Market is attractive

**Analyses:**
1. Size Canadian self-publishing market [Degree 3: Industry reports]
2. Assess distribution channel access [Degree 4: Talk to distributors]
3. Map competitive landscape [Degree 3: Web research + Degree 4: Expert interviews]

**Prioritization:**
- Market size: High decisiveness, Easy → DO FIRST
- Distribution: High decisiveness, Medium → DO CAREFULLY
- Competition: Medium decisiveness, Easy → DO IF TIME

### Example: Issue Tree

**Question:** "How should we reduce customer churn?"

**Sub-Question 1:** Why are customers leaving?

**Analyses:**
1. Analyze churn data by segment [Degree 2: Internal data]
2. Exit interviews with churned customers [Degree 6: Qualitative research]
3. Survey at-risk customers [Degree 7: Quantitative research]

**Prioritization:**
- Data analysis: High decisiveness, Easy → DO FIRST
- Exit interviews: High decisiveness, Medium → DO CAREFULLY
- Survey: Medium decisiveness, Hard → DO IF TIME

## Avoiding Analysis Paralysis

**Symptoms:**
- Endless data gathering
- Analyzing everything exhaustively
- Afraid to make recommendation
- Always wanting "just one more analysis"

**Solutions:**
1. Set deadlines for each analysis
2. Use satisficing principle
3. Force interim conclusions
4. Remember: "good enough to decide" > "perfect"

## Working with Uncertainty

Not all analyses will give clear answers. Learn to work with ambiguity:

**When Findings Are Unclear:**
- State what you do/don't know
- Quantify uncertainty ranges
- Conduct sensitivity analysis
- Make conditional recommendations

**Example:**
- "If market is >$50M, expand; if <$20M, don't; if $20-50M, do pilot first"

## Integration with Other Steps

**With Structure:**
- Structure identifies what to analyze
- Early analyses may reveal need to revise structure

**With Sell:**
- Analyses provide evidence for arguments
- Quality of analysis = credibility of recommendation
- Anticipate challenges, address them

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-analyzing low-impact questions**
2. **Under-analyzing high-impact questions**
3. **Using complex methods when simple would do**
4. **Forgetting to triangulate**
5. **Not checking data quality**
6. **Analyzing without clear purpose**
7. **Confusing precision with accuracy**

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Is this analysis decisive? (Changes recommendation?)
  NO → Skip or use Degree 1-2
  YES ↓
Is it easy to do? (Low time/cost)
  YES → Do it (Degree 1-3)
  NO ↓
Is uncertainty acceptable?
  YES → Do simpler version (Degree 1-4)
  NO → Invest in thorough analysis (Degree 5-7)
```

Remember: The goal is not to analyze everything perfectly, but to analyze enough to make a confident, well-founded recommendation.
