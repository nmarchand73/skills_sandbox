# Case Examples from "Cracked It!"

## Case 1: Music Industry (Flawed Problem Definition)

**Initial Problem Statement:** "How to stop piracy?"

**What Was Wrong:**
- Defined problem as piracy (diagnosis) not declining sales (symptom)
- Framed narrowly around stopping behavior
- Missed that "piracy" was actually disruption of distribution model

**Better Problem Statement:**
- Trouble: Sales declining 15% annually
- Owner: Major label CEO
- Success: Restore revenue growth
- Solution space: New business models, not just enforcement

**Lesson:** Describe symptoms, not diagnoses. Avoid narrow framing.

## Case 2: Grameen-Danone (Solution Confirmation)

**Situation:** Partnership to sell fortified yogurt to poor Bangladeshis

**The Hypothesis:**
- Product solution: Fortified yogurt addresses malnutrition
- Distribution solution: Village women sell door-to-door

**What Was Wrong:**
- Never tested whether target customers would buy yogurt
- Assumed solution worked without validation
- Price was too high for target market
- Cultural fit issues (not traditional food)

**Lesson:** Test hypotheses, don't just confirm them. Question assumptions.

## Case 3: Call Center (Wrong Framework)

**Initial Solution:** Use personality tests to reduce turnover

**Framework Assumption:**
- Personality traits predict tenure
- HR analytics can solve retention

**What Was Missing:**
- Root cause was poor working conditions, not wrong hires
- Framework focused on hiring, ignored environment
- Would select for people who couldn't get other jobs

**Lesson:** Question framework assumptions. Don't let tools blind you to reality.

## Case 4: J.C. Penney (Narrow Framing)

**Hypothesis:** Apple Store model will work for J.C. Penney

**What Went Wrong:**
- Analogical reasoning from wrong comparison
- Apple customers ≠ J.C. Penney customers
- Eliminated promotions customers loved
- Didn't understand user needs

**Better Approach:**
- Empathize with actual J.C. Penney shoppers
- Test changes with prototypes
- Don't assume one model fits all

**Lesson:** Avoid superficial analogies. Understand your users.

## Case 5: Sugar vs. Fat (Miscommunication)

**Two Competing Hypotheses:**
- Yudkin: Sugar causes obesity/heart disease
- Keys: Fat causes obesity/heart disease

**Why Wrong Theory Won:**
- Keys: Simple message, charismatic communication, institutional support
- Yudkin: Complex explanation, poor communication, mild-mannered

**Why Right Theory Eventually Prevailed:**
- Lustig: Masterful scientific communication (YouTube video)
- Clear core message, compelling examples, visual explanations

**Lesson:** Being right isn't enough. Must communicate persuasively.

## Case 6: Librinova Expansion (Hypothesis Pyramid Example)

**Leading Hypothesis:** Expand to Canada via De Marque partnership

**Pyramid Structure:**
1. Market is attractive
   - Size >$50M
   - Distribution accessible
   - Competition manageable
   - Publishers open to platform

2. Partner is suitable
   - De Marque has capabilities
   - Alignment of interests
   - Trust/relationship exists

3. Economics work
   - Revenue projections positive
   - Cost structure viable
   - ROI >20%

4. Implementation feasible
   - Resources available
   - Timeline achievable
   - Risks manageable

**Lesson:** Hypothesis pyramid structures validation effort efficiently.

## Case 7: Solar Corporation (Issue Tree Example)

**Core Question:** What to do with loss-making divisions?

**Issue Tree:**
1. Can we fix the divisions?
   - Can we improve operations?
   - Can we reposition products?
   - Can we reduce costs?

2. Should we divest?
   - Is there a buyer?
   - At what price?
   - What are alternatives?

3. What are strategic implications?
   - Impact on overall portfolio
   - Employee relations
   - Customer impact

**Lesson:** Issue tree explores problem comprehensively without bias.

## Pattern Recognition Across Cases

**Common Success Factors:**
- Clear problem statement (TOSCA)
- Appropriate structure (pyramid vs. tree)
- Rigorous analysis (8 degrees)
- Creative solutions (design thinking when needed)
- Persuasive communication (pyramid principle)

**Common Failure Modes:**
- Jumping to solutions
- Confirmation bias
- Wrong frameworks
- Narrow framing
- Poor communication

## Quick Reference: Which Approach When?

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Clear hypothesis, time pressure | Hypothesis Pyramid |
| Novel problem, no clear answer | Issue Tree |
| Standard business problem | Framework-based Tree |
| User-centered, ambiguous | Design Thinking |
| Quantitative decision | Analytical |
| Need creativity | Design Thinking |

## Applying the Method: Step-by-Step

1. **Recognize you have a problem** (not just executing)
2. **State it using TOSCA** (don't skip this!)
3. **Choose structure approach:**
   - Strong hypothesis? → Pyramid
   - Open question? → Tree
   - User problem? → Design Thinking
4. **Plan analyses** (decisiveness × difficulty)
5. **Execute with rigor** (but don't over-analyze)
6. **Build storyline** (answer first!)
7. **Create presentation** (pyramid principle)
8. **Deliver persuasively** (know your audience)

## When to Iterate Back

**Revisit STATE when:**
- Structure reveals problem is different
- Analyses show wrong question
- Stakeholders push back on framing

**Revisit STRUCTURE when:**
- Analyses reveal missing branches
- Initial structure isn't MECE
- New information changes logic

**Revisit SOLVE when:**
- First analyses aren't decisive
- Need different evidence
- Recommendation isn't clear

## The Meta-Lesson

**Problem solving is iterative, not linear.**

The 4S method provides structure, but you'll loop between steps as you learn. The discipline is in having a method, not in following it rigidly.
