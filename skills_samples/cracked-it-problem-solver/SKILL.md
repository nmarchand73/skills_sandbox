# Cracked It! Problem Solver

Comprehensive problem-solving methodology based on top strategy consulting practices. This skill provides the complete framework from the book "Cracked It! How to Solve Big Problems and Sell Solutions Like Top Strategy Consultants" by Bernard Garrette, Corey Phelps, and Olivier Sibony.

## The 4S Method

The core framework consists of four integrated steps:

1. **STATE** - Define the problem precisely using TOSCA framework
2. **STRUCTURE** - Break down the problem using pyramids, trees, or frameworks  
3. **SOLVE** - Analyze systematically or use design thinking for creative solutions
4. **SELL** - Communicate recommendations persuasively

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this skill when facing:
- Complex, ill-defined strategic problems
- Situations requiring systematic analysis and structuring
- Problems where initial framing may be wrong
- Need to generate creative solutions to ambiguous challenges
- Requirement to convince stakeholders and decision-makers
- Multi-faceted business issues with many unknowns
- Problems prone to cognitive biases (confirmation bias, narrow framing, etc.)

## The Five Pitfalls to Avoid

Before applying the method, understand the common traps:

1. **Flawed Problem Definition** - Solving the wrong problem
2. **Solution Confirmation** - Believing in a solution without testing it
3. **Wrong Framework** - Using analytical models that blind you to root causes
4. **Narrow Framing** - Limiting solutions through superficial analogies
5. **Miscommunication** - Failing to sell even brilliant solutions

## Workflow

### Step 1: STATE the Problem

Use the TOSCA framework to define the problem precisely:

```
T - Trouble: What makes this real and urgent?
O - Owner: Whose problem is this?
S - Success Criteria: What does success look like?
C - Constraints: What are the limitations and trade-offs?
A - Actors: Who are the stakeholders?
```

Then formulate a clear Core Question that captures the essence.

**Read:** `references/tosca-framework.md` for complete guidance on problem statement.

### Step 2: STRUCTURE the Problem

Choose your structuring approach based on problem type:

**Option A: Hypothesis Pyramid** (when you have a strong initial hypothesis)
- Build from answer hypothesis down to sub-hypotheses
- Fast but risky - prone to confirmation bias
- Best when: Time pressure, clear initial direction, experienced team

**Option B: Issue Tree** (when problem is genuinely open)
- Break question into mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE) sub-questions
- Slower but more thorough
- Best when: Novel problems, no clear hypothesis, diverse team

**Option C: Analytical Frameworks**
- Use established business frameworks (Porter's 5 Forces, 4Ps, Value Chain, etc.)
- Quick structuring but may force wrong perspective
- Best when: Standard business problems, need speed, framework truly fits

**Read:** `references/structure-methods.md` for detailed breakdown methods.
**Read:** `references/analytical-frameworks.md` for framework library and selection guidance.

### Step 3: SOLVE the Problem

**Path A: Analytical Problem Solving**

For problems that can be solved through systematic analysis:

1. Develop analysis plan from structure (pyramid or tree)
2. Apply "Eight Degrees of Analysis":
   - Degree 1: Back-of-envelope calculations
   - Degree 2: Existing internal knowledge
   - Degree 3: Existing external knowledge
   - Degree 4: Consultation with experts
   - Degree 5: Structured analysis of compiled data
   - Degree 6: Primary qualitative research (interviews, observation)
   - Degree 7: Primary quantitative research (surveys, experiments)
   - Degree 8: Academic-grade research

3. Prioritize analyses by:
   - Decisiveness (will it change the recommendation?)
   - Difficulty (time, cost, access to data)
   
**Read:** `references/analysis-methods.md` for complete analysis planning and execution.

**Path B: Design Thinking**

For complex, user-centered problems where solutions must be designed:

1. **Empathize** - Understand users deeply through observation and interviews
2. **Define** - Synthesize insights into clear problem statement
3. **Ideate** - Generate many possible solutions creatively
4. **Prototype** - Build quick, cheap versions to test concepts
5. **Test** - Validate with real users and iterate

Use design thinking when:
- Problem is poorly understood or hard to articulate
- Solution must be designed for people (customers, users, employees)
- Context is complex and full of unknowns
- Need creative, novel solutions rather than standard approaches

**Read:** `references/design-thinking.md` for complete 5-phase process.

### Step 4: SELL the Solution

Transform analysis into persuasive communication:

1. **Don't tell the story of your search** - Tell the story of the solution
2. **Use the Pyramid Principle**:
   - Start with the answer (core message)
   - Support with 3-5 key arguments
   - Each argument backed by evidence
   
3. **Design your storyline**:
   - Grouping pattern: "Three reasons why X is the answer"
   - Argument pattern: "Situation → Complication → Resolution"
   
4. **Create modular reports**:
   - Storyline pages (executive summary)
   - Content pages (detailed analysis)
   - Make every slide self-sufficient
   
5. **Quality control**:
   - Is it relevant? (So what?)
   - Is it true? (Says who?)
   - Is it new? (Should we care?)

**Read:** `references/communication.md` for presentation techniques, slide design, and delivery strategies.

## Integration with Design Thinking

The 4S method can integrate design thinking at multiple points:

- **STATE**: Use empathy interviews to deeply understand the problem
- **STRUCTURE**: Define and ideate can help reframe the problem
- **SOLVE**: Full design thinking process generates innovative solutions
- **SELL**: Prototypes and test results provide compelling evidence

Design thinking is especially powerful when analytical approaches hit walls.

## Key Principles

1. **Separate problem definition from solution generation** - State before Structure
2. **Make your logic explicit** - Show your reasoning structure
3. **Be hypothesis-driven but avoid confirmation bias** - Test, don't just validate
4. **Match analysis depth to decision importance** - Don't over-analyze
5. **Think like a consultant, but with creativity** - Rigor + imagination
6. **Communication is not cosmetic** - It's integral to problem solving
7. **Iterate ruthlessly** - Revisit STATE and STRUCTURE as you learn

## Common Questions

**When to use hypothesis pyramid vs. issue tree?**
- Use pyramid when: You have strong initial hypothesis, time pressure, experienced team
- Use tree when: Problem is truly novel, diverse perspectives needed, no clear direction

**When to use analytical frameworks?**
- They're quick but dangerous - only use when framework truly fits the problem
- Never force a problem into the wrong framework
- Always question framework assumptions

**When to pivot to design thinking?**
- Problem is hard to define precisely
- Analytical approach isn't yielding insights
- Solution requires creativity and user-centeredness
- Multiple iterations needed

**How much analysis is enough?**
- Analyze until you can confidently make a recommendation
- Prioritize decisive analyses over comprehensive ones
- Use "satisficing" - good enough to decide, not perfect
